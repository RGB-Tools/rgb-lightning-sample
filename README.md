# rgb-lightning-sample

This project is a fork of [ldk-sample] that currently only changes the crate
name and version in order to reserve the crate name in [crates.io].
We cannot publish RGB fork now since it depends on some unpublished
dependencies, but you can still clone and try the project by checking out the
[rgb-fork branch].
